**Project Overview:**

**Objective:**
To create a basic calculator application that performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers.

**Technology Stack:**
**Java:* Programming language used for the backend logic.

**Spring Boot:* Framework for building Java-based web applications.

**Maven:* Dependency management and project build tool .

**Components:**

**Controller:* Handles incoming HTTP requests, processes user inputs, performs calculations, and returns the result.

**Main Application Class:*Initializes and runs the Spring Boot application.

**Functionality:**
#Accepts two numbers and an operation as input parameters via HTTP GET requests.

#Performs the specified arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

#Returns the result of the operation as a response.

**Error Handling:**
#Handles division by zero error.

#Provides appropriate error messages for invalid operations or inputs.

**Testing:**
#Can be tested using a web browser or tools like Postman.
#Verify functionality for different arithmetic operations and input combinations.

**Potential Enhancements:**
#Improved error handling and validation for user inputs.

#Support for additional arithmetic operations or advanced mathematical functions.

#Adding a frontend interface for a better user experience.

**Deployment:**
#Deployable as a standalone Spring Boot application.
#Can be hosted on any server that supports Java applications.

**Scalability:**
#The project structure allows for easy scaling and adding new features as needed.
